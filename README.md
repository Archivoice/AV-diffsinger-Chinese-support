The [dictionary-cn.txt](/dictionary-cn.txt) is a minimal dictionary for training, will not work with OpenUtau or command-line interface (CLI) inference.
For use in OU, use the dictionary provided [here](/dsdict), and for CLI inference, use [this](/dict-cn-CLI.txt).

Additionally, the phoneme system uses `cn` as the language tag, so you can use this along with datasets labeled with OpenCPop's phoneme system without any edits.
